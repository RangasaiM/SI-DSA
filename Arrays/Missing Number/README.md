# Missing Number (Easy)

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode - Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

## Description

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

---

## Example 1

**Input:**  
`nums = [3, 0, 1]`

**Output:**  
`2`

**Explanation:**  
There are `n = 3` numbers, so the full range is `[0, 3]`. The number `2` is missing from the array.

---

## Example 2

**Input:**  
`nums = [0, 1]`

**Output:**  
`2`

**Explanation:**  
The range is `[0, 2]` since `n = 2`. The number `2` is missing from the array.

---

## Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**.
